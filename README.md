# GeoHealth: Efficient Hospital Search and Management System

## Objective
The *GeoHealth* project is a comprehensive hospital management system designed to efficiently manage and search hospital data using advanced data structures like *R-Tree, **Trie, **Heap, and **Stack*. It supports features such as location-based hospital searches, prefix-based search queries, priority-based hospital ratings, and search history tracking, providing a user-friendly and efficient solution for emergency and non-emergency scenarios.

---

## Features
1. *Hospital Management:*
   - Add, delete, and retrieve hospital information.
   - Prioritize high-rated hospitals for emergencies.

2. *Location-Based Searches:*
   - Utilize *R-Tree* for efficient spatial indexing of hospital locations.
   - Perform range and nearest neighbor queries.

3. *Name-Based Searches:*
   - Use *Trie* for prefix-based search, enabling autocomplete and efficient retrieval of hospital names and addresses.

4. *Hospital Ratings:*
   - Maintain hospital ratings with a *MaxHeap* to quickly access the highest-rated hospital.

5. *Search History:*
   - Track user searches using a *Stack* to provide quick access to recent searches.

## Data Structures and Their Applications
1. *R-Tree*: 
   - Efficiently indexes spatial data for location-based hospital searches.
   - Operations: 
     - Insertion: *O(log n)*  
     - Deletion: *O(log n)*  
     - Search: *O(log n + k)* (nearest neighbors)

2. *MaxHeap*:
   - Maintains and prioritizes hospitals based on ratings.
   - Operations: 
     - Insertion: *O(log n)*  
     - Maximum Retrieval: *O(1)*

3. *Trie*:
   - Facilitates fast prefix-based lookups for hospital names and addresses.
   - Operations: 
     - Insertion/Search/Deletion: *O(m)* (where m is the length of the key)

4. *Stack*:
   - Tracks user search history for quick reference.
   - Operations: 
     - Push/Pop/Peek: *O(1)*  
     - View History: *O(n)*
